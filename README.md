# uk-vs-covid-hack-whats-in-stock
An app where users can share information about current stock in open shops and tag it on the map. Other users could search and find products nearby (eggs, toilet roll â€¦) based on their location and avoid queues and crowds in chain supermarkets. Project for https://womendrivendev.org/ukvscovid19
